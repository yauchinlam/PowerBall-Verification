# PowerBall-Verification
I am creating a ASP .NET Core Web api that will predict the next lottery number based on my own algorithm.
It web API will update the back end database I created of all the previous lottery drawings and all the possible lottery drawings.
On the back end it will interact with my Microsoft SQL Server and used my algorithm to predict the most likely drawing.
On the front end, it will display my lottery number predictions and include a youtube video of the current drawing.
The project will considered complete once it can do all of that and website can change to mobile website.
